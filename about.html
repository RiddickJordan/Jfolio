        <p id="about_text" class="initial">Hi there! My name is Jordan. I'm passionate about education and have a voracious appetite for learning, but unlike most of my peers I don't have a traditional degree. At a young age I found myself disillusioned by the antiquated measurements of success utilized in high school and college, particularly that they never served as an accurate gauge for aptitude or expertise. Now thats not to say that I don't have a deep respect for any institution of higher learning, and that I didn't excel in every one of my classes (my parents would have killed me otherwise).<br>I believe that nothing is as powerful (or rare) as self-discovery - few of us are lucky to experience it in life, if ever. Luckily, during my second semester of college, I realized I found more motivation in tackling the challenges and work for my clients as a part-time programmer than I did from standardized coursework. It's with that realization that I took the plunge into dedicating my life to understanding the many intricacies of web development.  I left school and started a journey that took me from Virginia to Silicon Valley, using the crucible or real-world experience with clients in multiple industries to develop my trade. So far, I've accrued over eight years of experience working front end web technologies, healthy client relationships, and I have no plans to stop my life-long pursuit of learning more about these technologies. </p>
